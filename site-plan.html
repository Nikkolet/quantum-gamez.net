        <h2>Overview</h2>

            <i>Did you know?
          <br />
          <br />
          The word "quantum" has Latin roots and means "how much."

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            My idea is to create a fun and engaging website for all ages to learn Quantum Physics. It will teach them its history, fun facts, basic concepts, and fun games for them to enjoy. <br /><br /> There is a high demand for more advanced technology
            to meet humanity's needs and children are our future leaders. I am a web developer who can create this website collaborating with credible and qualified resources.
            <br /><br /> What if the world's technology could help cure all diseases, make space travel as common as traveling in a car, or expand the limits of virtual reality so that everyone can view history simulations as if they stepped back in time?
            <br /><br /> The people who will create that kind of technology tomorrow are our children today. We cannot invest in our future without investing in our children.
            <br /><br /> It's for all of us.
        </p>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
            My audience is children and young adults interested in learning about the world around them at their own pace. Quantum Gamez is for even the most complete beginner in the world of quantum physics. <br /><br /> Young Adults will love our high-graphic
            games and articles, and children can enjoy our variety of games, coloring pages, and videos.
            <br /><br /> Parents can breathe easy knowing their child or young adult is having fun learning on a website safe for them to explore.

        <h2>Style Guide</h2>

        <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

        <h3>Color Palette</h3>
        <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
        Palette URL:

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Luxurious Roman
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        It looks so sharp and clear. I love the way this font appears. I also
        wanted to try something different. This font stood out to me.
        <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Georgia
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I chose Georgia because it is easy and clear to read. I wouldn't have to
        strain my eyes reading this font in any way.

                    Atoms are the Building Blocks of the Universe! <br><br>Or so we thought. <br><br>For a long time we thought that atoms were the smallest things in the universe! In fact, the name "Atom" which is Latin, but it came from the Greek word
                    atomos which means â€˜indivisible' or cannot cut. Now we know that Atoms are actually made of tinier particles. <br><br> These smaller particles are called elementary particles. There are 61 known elementary particles. <br><br>Did you
                    know our beloved electron that is around the Nucleus of an Atom is one of them? <br><br>It's true! It's a type of Lepton Elementary Particle.
                    <br><br> Except an electron doesn't orbit around the Nucleus of an Atom like our Earth does around the Sun. <br><br>We'll explain more about that later!
                    <hr> We will talk about throughout this website?

                Learn about Quantum Computing and why this quantum computer looks like a golden chandelier. <br><br>Quantum Computers process information a lot faster than a regular computer does.<br><br>Check out how this changes things and what we may
                know because of this fancy computer!<br><br> Our Modern Computers communicate with each other using 1's and 0's. This is called a Bit. This can be compared to a light bulb in a room. The light is either on or off.<br><br>The symbol 1 meaning
                signal on and 0 meaning signal off. <br><br>A group of a combination of eight 0's and 1's is called a Byte.
                <br><br> Here is an Example:
                <br><br>
                <strong>English:</strong> Hi
                <br>
                <strong>Computer:</strong> 01001000 01101001
                <br><br> This is how information is shared using Classic Physics. That is a lot of numbers!
                <br><br> Thanks to Quantum Physics we know of what is called Superposition. Superposition is a system that has two different states that can define it and it's possible for it to exist in both. We use this in what is called Quantum Computing
                which is what is in Quantum Computers.
                <br><br> That means that in Quantum Computers it can be both 1 and 0. <br><br>Crazy, right?<br><br> This can be compared to air inside a basketball. The air can be in both the bottom and top of the inside of the basketbball.
                <br><br> Quantum Computers use Qubits instead of bits.
                <br><br> These Qubits makes the Quantum Computer run much faster and more powerful than a Modern Computer and helps us to solve more complex problems.
                <br><br>
                <hr> Later we will discuss what a quantum satalite is and how it will change the future!
